	 <p>This magnificent being is a middle-aged monkey chef who has been shrunk to the size of a paperclip by an evil scientist. He escaped the lab when the scientist wasn't looking and ventures out in the real world as a tiny version of himself. Although at first, he thought he was doomed, he learns to his surprise that there is a whole civilization in this tiny world that are just like him. As he treks through unfamiliar territory, he finds himself making unlikely friends, but also finds that there are malignant beings hidden in the grass. Though at first, he is hesitant to harm other beings since he is a peaceful chef, he quickly learns that in this tiny society, one learns to kill or be killed. It is your job to fight through the monsters of this world while simultaneously collecting the ingredients for an antidote to get him back to his original size.</p>
