	 I found an image of burnt ashes on Google images that was sufficiently large (1300 by 867) and imported it into Photoshop. From there, I went into the Filters menu and selected Filter Gallery. I picked Craquelure filter and adjusted the settings (I set the Crack Spacing field to 15, the Crack Depth field to 6, and the Crack Brightness field to 9) in order to get a grainy, sort of retro look in my image and to accentuate the grooves in the ash. Then, to make the texture, I created a new Photoshop file with twice the dimensions as the original, and duplicated the original layer four times into it. Then, after moving the layers so that the whole page was covered, I used the patch tool to smoothen the edges between the four duplicated layers. I then merged the layers and went under Image->Adjustments->Black and White to make the ashes completely black and white, like an old movie. Then I increased the contrast so the whole thing had a dark vibe to it and imported a picture of a daffodil. I then used the magic wand selection tool to select the background of the daffodil (which I didn't want) and deleted it, leaving me with a rough picture of only the daffodil's petals and its stem. Finally, I used the eraser tool to gently wipe clean the edges and moved it to the middle of the image, leaving me with the daffodil contrasting gloriously against the dark background. 

I wanted this picture to evoke a sense of hope. Though ashes symbolize death in their very essence, a daffodil symbolizes eternity, happiness, and long life. Even if the audience does not know this, they surely realize it because of the way I have set up the texture. The texture's dark overtones contrast highly with the bright colors of the daffodil, and the audience cannot help but be drawn to it. I want people to look at this and wonder, how can a daffodil be growing in ashes of all places? This image really shows that, even in the darkest times, people need to remember that there are still good things in life that are worth living for, which is why I've decided to put this contrast specifically in this image.
